# Introduction
Please take some time to read and understand this file. This will help keep the project clean and transparent for all contributors. It will also make it easier for admins and moderators to merge your code suggestions.

# Forks
The first part is to create your own fork of the project. You can do this directly from GitHub by pressing the fork button in the top right corner. This will create a copy of the repository on your account. In this repository you can do whatever you want without it affecting the original repository. As long as you adhere to the following rules when branching and creating pull requests (PR).

# Branches
When creating a new branch please adhere to the following guidelines:
- The branch should match one of the below
- The branch "sections" are seperated with "/" (slash)
- The branch name is lowercase

## Issue fixing branch
If the branch you are creating fixes an issue please name the branch:  
`issue/(Issue #)/(GitHub name)`

This signals that the branch is trying to fix a known issue.

## Feature branch
If you would like to add a new feature that you feel is missing. Please create a feature-request issue on the original repository, this way a issue number gets created. Then create the branch with the name:  
`feature/(Issue #)/(GitHub name)`

## Examples

`issue/18/vitexftw`
