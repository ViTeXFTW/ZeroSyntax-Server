Things that cause the AI to mismatch in multiplayer

- Building scaffolds in the AI base within the first minute or so
- Attacking/Rushing the AI within the first 2 minutes or so

- When a unit fires a weapon that uses dumb projectiles fires too close to itself
  You can make a test map containing all DumbProjectile units and test them out individually. Steps to reproduce are:
  1. Select a tank
  2. Force fire as close as possible to the firing point/bone
  3. Look for projectile detonation FX (graphics + audio) at the bottom left corner of the map.
     - If they appear in that spot (and thus disappear from the force-fired position), that means the game would mismatch in MP
     - tanks in ZH have low weapon speed 300/400 so they are not affected)
